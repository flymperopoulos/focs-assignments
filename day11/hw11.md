Check one:
[*] I completed this assignment without assistance or external resources.
[ ] I completed this assignment with assistance from ___
   and/or using these external resources: ___
```

## I. Formal Proofs

Use the rules of inference from class (reprinted below) to construct formal, numbered proofs of the following:

### 1. 

Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

```
p -> q
p -> r
(q AND r) -> q
(q AND r) -> r
p -> (q AND r)
```

### 2.

Assuming _p -> (q OR r)_ and _p -> (q OR NOT r)_, prove _p -> q_

```
p -> (q OR r)
p -> (q OR ~r)
p -> ((q OR r) AND (q OR ~r))
p -> (q OR (r AND ~r))
p -> (q OR F)
p -> q

```

## II. Truth tables

Use a truth table to show the equivalence of the assumptions and conclusion from problem 1, above:  Assuming _p -> q_ and _p -> r_, prove _p -> (q AND r)_

[Style note:  what is the canonical order of the rows in a truth table for three propositions?]


| p | q | r |p -> q|(q AND r)|p -> (q AND r)|
| --|:--:|:--:|:----:|:-------:|------------:|
| T | T | T |  T   |    T    |     T        |
| T | T | F |  T   |    F    |     F        | 
| T | F | F |  F   |    F    |     F        |
| T | F | T |  F   |    F    |     F        |
| F | T | T |  T   |    T    |     T        |
| F | T | F |  T   |    F    |     T        |
| F | F | T |  T   |    F    |     T        |
| F | F | F |  T   |    F    |     T        |



## III. Tautology, satisfiable, contradiction

Which of the following are tautologies?  Satisfiable?  Unsatisfiable (contradictions)?

### 1. _(p AND q AND r) -> (p OR q)_

Tautology.

### 2. _((p -> q) AND (q -> r)) -> (p -> r)_

Satisfiable.

### 3. _(p -> q) -> p_

Tautology. 

### 4. _(p OR q OR r) AND ((NOT p) OR (NOT q) OR (NOT r)) AND (p OR (NOT q)) AND (q OR (NOT r)) OR (r OR (not p))_ 

Unsatisfiable - there is not combination of p, q, r that satisfies.

### 5. [** challenge/optional] _(p <=> (q OR r)) -> ((NOT q) -> (p AND r))_

## IV. CNF

Transform the following formula into conjunctive normal form.  Show your steps.

_p OR (q AND NOT (r AND (s -> t)))_

```
p OR (q AND ~ (r AND (s -> t)))
p OR (q AND ~ (r AND (~s OR t)))
p OR (q AND ~ ((r AND ~s) OR (r AND t)))
p OR (q AND (~(r AND ~s) AND ~(r AND t)))
p OR (q AND (~r OR s) AND (~r OR ~t))
(p OR q) AND (p OR (~r OR s)) AND (p OR (~r OR ~t))

```

## V. Short certificate

Demonstrate that the formula in problem IV is satisfiable.  Explain whether you used a  "short certificate" or exhaustive enumeration to make this determination.

```
The statement is satisfiable if simply p is true (no matter what the other variables are).
```
