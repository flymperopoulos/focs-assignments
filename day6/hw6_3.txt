Such a machine would not be more powerful. This holds
because we can express any letter in the {a, b, c, ..., z} alphabet 
in binary form and, therefore, the {0,1} alphabet, with 5 digits. In other words, 
a would be 00001, b would be equal to 00010 and so on until z (the equivalent of 26) is 11010.
As a result, we would be able to construct an NFA (or DFA, if you have time to mess around)
that would undestand both languages.
